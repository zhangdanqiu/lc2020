## Drone Transport Simulation
This is a small project I wrote these days.
#### Description
The user can create Drones and assign them different jobs. The jobs are stored into a drone transport schedule. All the transport information and drone information will be writen to the disk. 
The schedule was writen by singelton mode to keep there is only one schedule instance in the whole project.
The drones are sorted by id. 

#### How to start
Main mathod is in DroneTest class.
Drone are created by the "new" keyword.
Users can create a new task then assign it to the drone. The drone informations can be printed on console when calling print() method.


#### Next Step
I will add JPanels to the project and draw the result of drone simulation.
